# ScrapBook
The project “SCRAPBOOK” is developed to provide a system for managing the book search processes which will be taking place (activity conducted) in the schools and colleges. It is a very tedious process to search the books of a very large population of books. So the above mentioned situation can be avoided by this system where the user consumes very less amount of time to find and know about a book in a social networking media where a reader, a publisher and an author can chat, post and much more. It consumes less amount of time when compared to the manual paper work through the automated system.  

The system is user friendly and includes all the features needed to process the book search. It includes registering the authors name for various books, uploading, counting of individual search for all the positions and publishing the books and even it provides a support system from admins.

The project is capable of searching, uploading the books, chatting, authors report etc. and helps the users to view the books list and chat with other authors. And it helps the administrators to publish the details without having to manually search and also avoids paper work.
